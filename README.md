# Flashcards

This is an android app made with Raect Native. You can make multiple decks and fill them with flashcards to test yourself with.  

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and install the dependancies using NPM.

```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
$ git clone https://github.com/BLBaylis/flashcards.git
$ cd flashcards
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Have an android emulator at the ready, then 

```
$ npm run android
```
The Metro bundler will open, most likely on port 19001 and your browser will open at localhost:19002.  In this newly opened window, you have the option of turning on production mode which will increase the app's performance and disable developer logs.

Enjoy!
